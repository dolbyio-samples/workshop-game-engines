## Best Real-time Social Experience ($750)

?> Connect people from around the world to have immersive social experiences. Use the Dolby.io SDKs to provide
real-time streaming and/or spatial communications to your experience.

Getting started with new technologies can be fun, but sometimes you might need some ideas to get started.  Here's a collection of thought starters to get your creative thinking going. 

* Imagine you could host your own personal live musical performance where your friends could be anywhere in the world and not have to sacrifice the quality of experience. 

* It could be a friend's gathering for karaoke or hosting a big audience for something like Coachella or Tomorrowland.


* Many career fairs take place with the idea that everybody will have a chance to talk to their preferred recruiter. What if we were able to have a virtual space with all of the booths set up days before the event for companies to meet developers and show them their work virtually?

* Meet-ups happen all the time, and many complain that it needs more personal experience when not in person. Create a social, collaborative space that you wished you had before.
* Watch parties have become a commonality for many streaming services, yet they still need the most essential component, interactiveness. 

* Build a camping space where you are live streaming your favorite content. At the same time, you can imagine your friends sitting next to you, whispering that this is their favorite part. 
  
* Telling stories in today's world has been overly reliant on a 2D screen. Many have ventured into 3D, but nothing has ever indeed been immersive without some flaws. The audio might be lacking, or some latency prevents you from thinking you are inside the experience. Help capture an interactive story that takes place as a first POV!

* Whether it be a film festival or a Q&A section, have an auditorium filled with people who aren't able to attend in person to get the same type of interactiveness. The main individuals giving the talk or being interviewed could be MOCAP-ed and later projected inside the venue. 
  
* For a fitness or meditation class, have an instructor giving you spatial instructions to enhance your ability to concentrate. 

# Technical Starters - special SWAG or opportunities
* Extend SDK to bring in other audio features
* Target devices and integrations with hardware products

The [Dolby.io Community Writing Program](https://go.dolby.io/community-writing) exists to enable developers around the world to create innovative applications, guides, and stories to share their work by building with Dolby.io APIs and SDKs. Unlike most other community writing programs, we wish to let you keep ownership of your own work and publication, while still offering fair compensation and social sharing opportunities.
